# Hadoop Huffmann Coding
A painful little Project I had to do in university. It creates a Huffmann tree from a set of Words using MapReduce in Hadoop.
If anyone else ever has to something like this, this will hopefully help.

The list of Words should look like the following:
```
lorem
ipsum
dolor
bitte
erloese
mich
von
dem 
leid
```
